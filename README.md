üìß Spam Email Detection using NLP

This mini project focuses on building a Spam Email Classifier using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning models. The goal is to automatically classify emails as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) by analyzing their textual content.

üîë Key Features

Dataset Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared raw email text (removing stopwords, punctuation, and applying tokenization & stemming/lemmatization).

Feature Extraction: Implemented Bag of Words (BoW) / TF-IDF vectorization to convert text into numerical features.

Model Training: Trained machine learning models like Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, and Random Forest to classify emails.

Evaluation: Measured performance using Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-score to ensure reliability.

‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK, Matplotlib

Concepts Used: NLP (Tokenization, Lemmatization, Feature Extraction), Supervised Machine Learning

üìä Outcome

Successfully achieved high accuracy in detecting spam emails.

Demonstrates the practical application of NLP + ML in text classification tasks.
